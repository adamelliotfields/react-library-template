> A template for building React libraries.

## Usage

This isn't a CLI tool like [`create-react-library`](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/create-react-library).
It's merely a place to store configuration files so I may reference them in the future.

## Features

### Rollup

CJS, ES, and UMD bundles are emitted. The UMD bundle is minified.

### TypeScript

The [`tsconfig.json`](./tsconfig.json) is based on the one generated by [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/v3.4.0/packages/react-scripts/scripts/utils/verifyTypeScriptSetup.js#L94).

[`rollup-plugin-typescrip2`](https://github.com/ezolenko/rollup-plugin-typescript2) is used to generate type declarations.

### Babel

The [`.babelrc`](./.babelrc) uses [`babel-preset-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/v3.4.0/packages/babel-preset-react-app).
Edit `.browserslistrc` to adjust which browsers you want to support.

### Jest

[`enzyme`](https://github.com/enzymejs/enzyme) and [`jest-enzyme`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/enzyme-matchers/tree/master/packages/jest-enzyme)
are used for unit/integration testing.

### ESLint

The [`.eslintrc`](./.eslintrc) uses [`eslint-config-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/v3.4.0/packages/eslint-config-react-app)
with overrides from Prettier.

### Prettier

You can adjust [`.prettierrc`](./.prettierrc) and add any files you don't want beautified to [`.prettierignore`](./.prettierignore).

### Terser

The Terser options are imported directly from the Webpack config from [`react-scripts`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/v3.4.0/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js#L210).

### Storybook

Storybook uses the Webpack config from [`react-scripts`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/v3.4.0/packages/react-scripts/config/webpack.config.js).

The [`centered`](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/centered), [`knobs`](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/knobs)
and [`viewport`](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/viewport) addons are also included.

### GitHub Actions and Packages

There are multiple actions and steps in [`build.yml`](./build.yml).

When pushing or merging into `master`, a package will be published to this repository using GitHub
Packages. Update the `publishConfig` field in [`package.json`](./package.json) to publish to a
different registry. See [Semantic Release](#semantic-release) below.

### Semantic Release

[`semantic-release`](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) is used to generate
changelogs for releases automatically. If the version number is bumped, a package will be published.

You will need to create a GitHub [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with
`repo` and `packages` scopes and store it in a secret named `GH_TOKEN` in your repository.

You should familiarize yourself with how `semantic-release` works, including the
[Angular Commit Message Format](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines)
and the [default rules matching](https://github.com/semantic-release/commit-analyzer/blob/v8.0.1/README.md#default-rules-matching).

If you're not comfortable with the concept of [continuous delivery](https://continuousdelivery.com),
you should remove `semantic-release` from [`build.yml`](./.github/workflows/build.yml).

### Code Climate

[Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/quality/pricing) is used for coverage and automated code
reviews. You'll need to create a free account and add your repository. Then, in your Code Climate
settings, copy your **Test Reporter ID** and store it in a secret named `CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID` in
in your repository.

### Dependabot

Dependabot is used to keep your dependencies up-to-date. You just need to enable the
[Dependabot Preview](https://github.com/marketplace/dependabot-preview) app from GitHub Marketplace.
